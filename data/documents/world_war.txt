Brief Notes on World War II

World War II (WWII) was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the vast majority of the world's countriesâ€”forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.

Key Theaters:
- European Theater: Primarily involved Germany, Italy (Axis) against the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union (after 1941), and the United States (after 1941) (Allies). Major events include the invasion of Poland, the Battle of Britain, Operation Barbarossa (invasion of the USSR), D-Day, and the Battle of Stalingrad.
- Pacific Theater: Primarily involved Japan (Axis) against the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and other Allied nations. Major events include the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Midway, island hopping campaigns, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Causes: Unresolved issues from World War I, aggressive expansionism by Axis powers (Germany, Italy, Japan), failures of international diplomacy (League of Nations), and the Great Depression's economic impact.

Consequences: Massive loss of life (estimated 50-85 million), the formation of the United Nations, the beginning of the Cold War between the US and USSR, the decline of European colonial empires, and the emergence of the US and USSR as superpowers.
