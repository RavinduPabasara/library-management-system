Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Research

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field focused on creating systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Key areas of research include:

- Machine Learning (ML): Algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Subfields include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications include translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.
- Computer Vision: Allowing machines to interpret and understand information from images or videos. Used in facial recognition, object detection, and medical imaging analysis.
- Robotics: Designing and building robots capable of performing physical tasks. Often integrates AI for autonomy and decision-making.
- Ethical AI: Addressing the societal impacts, biases, fairness, and transparency of AI systems. This is crucial as AI becomes more integrated into daily life.

Challenges in AI research include data requirements, computational costs, explainability (understanding *why* an AI makes a decision), and mitigating potential risks.
